This tactic has earned ICC over 1,500 enemies, making him one of the most disliked players in Torn.

Despite his generosity, he continues to dominate numerous Hall of Fame categories, including respect earned, attacks made, and many other impressive metrics.

1405,RGiskard's Keepsake,"A leader by example, respected by both factionmates and foes, RGiskard was a stabilizing force in Relentless during turbulent times and a founding member of its successor, Monarch. His calm under pressure earned him the trust to lead wartime tactics and manage investment funds, cementing his well-rounded reputation. However, he is mightily unbalanced in one area—his battle stats. As the first to reach 1 quadrillion in strength, one player described him as 'half algorithm, half deity,' a title that perfectly matches his namesake, Giskard—the robot from Isaac Asimov's works who could read and influence minds, perhaps hinting at the true source of RGiskard's relentless success.",,,Collectible,,0,0,0,250,https://www.torn.com/images/items/1405/large.png,TRUE

A key figure in the evolution of Calculating into Relentless and then Monarch, he was the heart and soul of Torn's strongest faction family. His keen eye for patterns and stats helped countless new players with his power-leveling guide, but the WSSB scandal saw Hank's name tainted, unfairly, according to some, when his alleged use of a stock market exploit resulted in a $136 billion fine.

Mikk has faced plenty of setbacks in Torn, from losing his entire fortune early on to enduring the indignity of co-leading a faction with d3vl. Yet his achievements speak for themselves, particularly his mass of awards—at one point, he ranked in the top 5 across 10 Hall of Fame categories and managed to acquire every item in Torn. A founding member of the recently resurrected Hat Trick family, which once dominated Torn as a Norwegian-only faction, Mikk has told his wife many times that he's quit this 'stupid game,' but it is to Torn's benefit that he continues to lie to his spouse.",,,Collectible,,0,0,0,250,https://www.torn.com/images/items/1407/large.png,TRUE

Her low status belied her impressive battle stats, allowing someone to rack up enough defends to keep her in the all-time top ten as of 2024, despite not playing for a decade. But holding a low level came at a cost—her stats were eventually reduced by 99% due to her inability to fly and rehabilitate. Her profile was also often plastered with bounties, many likely due to being wrongly blamed for others' stealth attacks. In the end, the player with the most generic name and founder of the Nameless faction suffered an ironic fate, as she was fedded for having multiple identities.",,,Collectible,,0,0,0,250,https://www.torn.com/images/items/1408/large.png,TRUE

At one point, he even had a negative speed stat due to an addiction bug, a situation he famously worsened by using a skateboard—much to the community’s amusement. As of 2024, this remains the only SE CockyNudist has ever used, and he continues to stubbornly refuse to set foot in a gymnasium. Despite his unique approach, he manages to get by quite well, though his lack of stats costs him dearly in ammunition—a fact reflected by his status as the player with the most rounds fired in Torn history.",,,Collectible,,0,0,0,250,https://www.torn.com/images/items/1409/large.png,TRUE

Alongside House MD, he hosted the Graphics Aid website, where community-designed graphics were auctioned off, earning their creators billions in in-game revenue.

His crowning achievement came when he won the first-ever Ultimate Racing Tournament, then known as the PRC. His prize was a rare Bugatti Veyron, Torn’s fastest car, since renamed in his honor as the Stormatti Casteon. Described as a larger-than-life figure, Stormcast's passing was commemorated by the community with a tournament organized by the Night Racers and a special 1,000-driver tribute race at the end of the following URT.

The man responsible was JamilB, who unleashed a Dirty Bomb on Devastation, the bitter rivals of his own faction, Hells Angels. This cataclysmic attack, which cost a fortune in cash and cesium, tore 10,321 respect from the enemy faction and forever changed the landscape of Torn.

So, next time you use TT to block the latest DUDE wannabe on the forums, you’ll know who to thank.

His three-digit ID tells you just how long he’s been here, and for a time, he even served us in an official capacity—until the experience of looking under the hood proved too traumatic. Yet as an external developer, IBF’s impact is unmatched: he helped create Torn’s API, paving the way for Torn’s future army of mug-scripters.

His work impressed the developers so much that TornPDA received official endorsement, and he was later hired to create Torn Lite.

Ara's current account is a restart after his original was fedded for real money trading. Since then, he's kept his nose clean, climbing into Torn's top 100 players (ask him about his strength).

She was also a regular presence on Torn Radio and Torn IRC, running countless giveaways.

TCbasic was so comprehensive that much of its content later formed the basis for the Torn Wiki. Though it has since become outdated and gone offline, TCbasic was once an essential roadmap, helping newcomers find their way through Torn's dangerous streets.

Described as instrumental by Chedburn himself, Quacks assisted our founder in establishing Torn, teaching him the basics of web development and helping him to program many of the game’s early features. If Chedburn was the architect, then Quacks was the builder—while not involved in design, he helped turn Ched’s ideas into reality, laying the foundations that have supported Torn for nearly two decades.

In a time when players pushed every boundary, Wynn reined them in, earning respect for her friendly, forgiving approach. Sadly, her generosity may have been her downfall; she lost her position after a scandal involving her spouse, Locked, a fellow admin who gifted himself stats and items. Perhaps that’s why she's the only staffer with two collectibles to her name.

Her zero-tolerance for nonsense extended to staff, keeping them on a tight leash and preventing abuses of power that had occurred in the past. -Clansdancer also made history as the first to complete a Political Assassination alongside Chedburn, with her stats tweaked to prove this organized crime could actually be completed.

His rigorous SSL training relied on boosters, with cost no obstacle for someone who was once our wealthiest player. Leuky also had a taste for luxury residences—at one point, he was the sole owner of a palace and later acquired Trekant Tower, one of our twelve unique properties. As an admin, Leuky had a nose for uncovering corruption, though some questioned his motives after the well-timed takedown of the infamous Tea, whose fedding took a quarter of the economy with him.

The lack of scrutiny makes these documents a favorite of tax evaders, money launderers, and organized criminals, a.k.a. billionaires, hence why the United States effectively banned new issues in 1982.

On the scale of shitty things to do, slaughtering a bear and removing its gallbladder is probably the kinder option, but Dr. Doolittle, you ain’t.

Doctors used to hand it out as a decongestant and bronchodilator back when old-timey meds were cool. These days ephedrine powder is used in the production of methamphetamines, which is why its distribution is tightly controlled.

However, much like its namesake game studio, obsidian is a one-hit wonder, its brittle nature causing it to shatter on impact.

Early Homo sapiens in what is now South Africa fashioned it into hand axes, scrapers, and projectile points, but today quartzite is used for more peaceful purposes like making kitchen countertops.

1502,Basalt Point,"Basalt is the most common volcanic rock on the planet and forms when lava cools quickly upon reaching the Earth's surface. Ancient Polynesian cultures used this material to make all manner of implements, including adzes, a hand tool with a curved blade used for slicing pizza-bound pineapple chunks. This basalt arrowhead is tougher and heavier than one made of flint or obsidian, and would have required its maker to grind the point rather than use knapping. Famous Hawaiians include Barack Obama, Bette Midler, and Bruno Mars, none of whom are known to have been pierced by a basalt arrowhead.",,,Artifact,,0,0,123890,27809,https://www.torn.com/images/items/1502/large.png,TRUE
1503,Chalcedony Point,"Chalcedony is a microcrystalline form of quartz formed when silica-rich fluids seep into rock cavities and solidify. The Patagonian region of Argentina is rich in chalcedony, with native prehistoric cultures using it to make knives, scrapers, and arrowheads. This material, which ranges in colour from white and blue to pinky reds, is easy to knap and its edges stay sharp longer than rival materials like obsidian. On the 22nd of June 1986, Diego Maradona scored a goal with his hand in the World Cup quarter-final against England. The cheating little shit would never have managed that if someone had fired a chalcedony point through his head in the 50th minute.",,,Artifact,,0,0,159129,26809,https://www.torn.com/images/items/1503/large.png,TRUE
1504,Quartz Point,"Quartz arrowheads were carved from quartz, surprisingly, with this one hailing from Canada, where large quartz deposits can be found. Indigenous cultures like the Cree and Athabaskan peoples used quartz points for hunting long before anyone discovered you could smother fries in cheese curds and gravy and call it dinner. Knapping a quartz arrowhead is a skilled practice, since it flakes unpredictably, much like humans do once they’ve got married and had kids. This quartz point can be placed in your mouth for luck, and if you’re lucky, it won’t slice your mouth clean open.",,,Artifact,,0,0,137141,29387,https://www.torn.com/images/items/1504/large.png,TRUE

1506,Copium Inhaler,"Copium is a mood stabilizing gas which allows the user to gain large quantities of self-belief when inhaled. Known on the street as Hot Air, C?P?U? is self-administered during the closing stages of a directionless rant directed at an unpaid volunteer who is almost certainly correct. Each pressurized canister has been recovered from the inventory of a detained player who did nothing wrong, besides harass those women, use “that” word, and share the family computer with their fifteen brothers. Prolonged use may result in wilful blindness, tone deafness, and selective memory loss.","Increases hubris by 10% over 180 minutes.
